Hello! My name is Prashurjya Bhagawati and I belong from Guwahati, Assam itself.
 Apart from academics I like to play football , swimming , watch web series etc.


 For me Open Source is a new domain as I got the change to explore it during the Coding Week.
 Firstly, I think it provides a great platform for personal growth and improvement. It can be a great way to explore different coding practices and learn from experienced developers.
 Secondly, it provides a platform through which I can contribute and have a meaningful impact on Software development and the community as well.  I believe it can also be a great way of networking with like minded developers and passionate individuals.
